// When building or rebuilding Docker images or containers, always refer to the instructions and workflows defined in PROJECT_RULES.md.
// All Docker-related operations (build, rebuild, start, restart) must strictly follow the documented process and recommendations in PROJECT_RULES.md to ensure team consistency and adherence to caching, environments, and compose usage.
